# Capstone-Project
Thsi was the final project done as part of Business Analyst Course 

Our analysis focused on using PySpark and Tableau to enhance Freddy's in-app orders and sales. We obtained 500GB of data from Freddy's and analyzed in-app sales for all states in the USA, with a specific focus on the Wichita location and its eligible stores for online ordering. To evaluate Freddy's performance against competitors like Door dash and Uber Eats, we compared the results of our analysis. In addition, we gathered external data such as per capita income and population figures for Wichita, which we used to gain deeper insights into Freddy's in-app sales performance. Our findings provide Freddy's with valuable information to make data-driven decisions and improve its sales in Wichita. Overall, our analysis helps Freddy's understand their sales performance in Wichita and make informed decisions based on the data we gathered. By using our findings, Freddy's can enhance their in-app sales.
